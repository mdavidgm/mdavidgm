## 🏛️ The Stoic Engineer: Kaizen and Pragmatism

My development approach is rooted in **Stoic Engineering**, a methodology I apply to create software that is sustainably excellent.

This philosophy combines the Stoic focus on **controllables** (the code we write) with the Kaizen principle of **continuous improvement**: making the software **1% better every day** through practical, real-world application changes.

I strive to build solutions that are:
* **Kaizen-Ready:** Designed for small, incremental, daily improvements.
* **Pragmatic:** Focusing engineering effort only on what is **essential and controllable** (the Stoic Dichotomy of Control).
* **High-Quality:** Driven by Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

## 🚀 About Me

I am an experienced Full Stack Developer specializing in the architecture and deployment of robust solutions.

I am deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and have built my own **army of agents**, contextually sharpened and prepared for battle like Spartans.

My work emphasizes **product quality** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**, using expected behavior as the guiding principle for construction.

I aim to build **scalable**, **secure**, and **easily maintainable** solutions that deliver true business value.

## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack

These are the technologies I routinely work with:

| Category | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Redux/Zustand, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS |
